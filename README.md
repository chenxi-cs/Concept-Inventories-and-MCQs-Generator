# Automated Concept Inventorues and MCQs Generation for CS Education

This project implements an AI-powered pipeline for **automatic generation of Concept Inventories (CIs)** and **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)** in the domain of introductory computer programming (CS1). The system combines **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, a structured **misconception database**, and **AST-based structural analysis** to produce high-quality, pedagogically valid MCQs.

---

## Features

- **Concept Extraction**  
  Parses Java textbooks (PDF) and extracts core programming concepts grouped by topic.

- **MCQ Generation**  
  Automatically generates:
  - Question stem
  - Correct answer
  - Bloom's Taxonomy level
  - Explanation

- **Distractor Generation**  
  Selects plausible distractors from a curated misconception database or generates them via GPT, enhanced by AST-based misconception detection.

- **Structural Filtering**  
  Uses a trained **BiGRU-based AST classifier** to detect and annotate structural misunderstandings in Java code snippets.

- **Automated Output**  
  Saves generated concepts and MCQs in both **JSON** and **CSV** formats for further analysis.

##  How It Works

### 1. **Concept Extraction**
- Extracts text from Java textbooks using `PyMuPDF (fitz)`
- Cleans and filters irrelevant content
- Splits into manageable chunks
- Sends chunks to **GPT-4o** to extract structured `(topic, concept)` pairs

### 2. **Question & Correct Answer Generation**
- Prompts GPT-4o to generate a question stem, correct answer, Bloom level, and explanation for each concept

### 3. **Distractor Generation**
- Retrieves distractors from the misconception database
- If insufficient, uses GPT-4o to generate new distractors
- Incorporates **AST misconception detection** to guide distractor creation

### 4. **Output Formatting**
- Shuffles options and labels them A-D
- Exports results to CSV and JSON

##  Evaluation

- **Evaluation Dimensions**:
  1. Semantic clarity
  2. Distractor misleadingness
  3. Bloom taxonomy alignment
  4. Option diversity & consistency

- **Results**:
  - **82%** of generated MCQs met quality standards
  - Highest scores: semantic clarity (4.07/5), option consistency (4.00/5)
  - Main area for improvement: distractor misleadingness (3.53/5)

##  Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Install dependencies:
  '''bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  '''
- '.env' file with your **OpenAI API key**:
  '''env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  '''

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the System

1. Place Java textbook PDFs in the 'PDFs/' folder.
2. Ensure 'fallback_distractors.csv' and 'distractor_output/' exist.
3. Run:
   '''bash
   python generate_mcq4.py
   '''

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit your '.env' file** containing the OpenAI API key.
- If a key is accidentally pushed to GitHub, **revoke it immediately** from your OpenAI account dashboard.
